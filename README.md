📘 Algorithm Challenge #49 – ATM PIN Verification
-
This challenge simulates a basic ATM PIN check. The program asks the user to enter their PIN and keeps prompting until the correct one is entered. After verification, it displays the user’s account balance.

This task helps strengthen loop logic, conditional checks, and user input validation in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
• Using while loops for repeated input

• Basic authentication logic

• Comparing user input securely

• Displaying account information

• Improving input validation instincts


🧩 Example
-
Input:

Enter your PIN → 1111

Wrong PIN

Enter PIN → 1222

Output:

Your Balance is: $8000

📂 File Information
-
• Language: C++

• File Name: atm_pin_verification.cpp

• Challenge Number: #49

💬 Notes
-
This is a classic example of loop control and basic authentication logic.

It helps strengthen fundamental problem-solving skills and reinforces user input handling.
